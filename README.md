# Van Gogh's preoccupation with colour

Vincent van Gogh frequently expressed his preoccupation with colour in his writings. He wrote, “…the painter of the future will be a colourist the like of which has never yet been seen. But I’m sure I am right to think that it will come in a later generation, and it is up to us to do all we can to encourage it, without question or complaint.”

He was deeply aware of the relationship colours had on each other. About complementary colours van Gogh gave this advice to artists, “Instead of trying to reproduce exactly what I see before me, I make more arbitrary use of colour to express myself more forcefully … To express the love of two lovers by the marriage of two complementary colours … To express the thought of a brow by the radiance of a light tone against a dark background. To express hope by some star. Someone’s passion by the radiance of the setting sun.”

One of Van Gogh's favorite colours was purple.
