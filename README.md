<h1>Monet’s Obsession With Colour</h1>

Colour may be the most important tool artists can use to express themselves, share their beliefs, convey a message and transform viewers intellectually and emotionally. Claude Monet exclaimed, “Colour is my day long obsession, joy and torment.” The artist repeatedly painted the same subject at different times of day and in different weather conditions. One of his best known series is “The Rouen Cathedral”. He captured the facade under different lighting conditions. They are excellent examples of how light affects color on subjects. He reworked these paintings in his studio, as he explored a myriad examples of colours and moods.

When giving advice to artists he wrote, “When you go out to paint, try to forget what objects you have before you, a tree, a house, a field or whatever. Merely think here is a little square of blue, here an oblong of pink, here a streak of yellow, and paint it just as it looks to you, the exact colour and shape.”

One of Monet's favorite colours was yellow.
